# Title - Seminar on Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing uses computational methods to process the information in spoken or written form of such free text data which acts as a mode of communication commonly used by humans.
There are a lot of processes involved in the pipeline of Natural Language Processing.
At the syntactic level, statements are segmented into words, tokens and each token is assigned with its label in the form of the noun, verb, adverb, adjective, and so on.
At the semantic level, each word is analyzed to get the meaningful representation of the sentence.
Hence, the basic task of NLP is to process the unstructured text and to produce a representation of its meaning. The higher-level tasks in NLP are Machine Translation (MT), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering System, Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Natural Language Generation (NLG).
